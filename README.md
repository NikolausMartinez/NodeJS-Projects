# Basic Weather App using Google geocode and DarkSki API's

# I didn't updload the node_modules I used for this app to GitHub
You need install all the node_modules from my package.json <br />
To do so while your in the weather-app directorty run command npm install <br />
This will install all the node_modules from my package.json
<br />

# The app.js uses callbacks with the request method.
# The app-promise.js uses promises and the axios library. This app only requires the app-promse.js file to run.<br />

Both app.js and app-promise.js can be used the same way. <br />
The app will take in an address from the user like: node app.js -a (address)  or node app-promise.js -a (address)<br />
The address could just be zipcode, street number and name (this must be entered as a string), or city and state. <br />

See attached app-promiseOutput.JPG for input/output layout for app-promise.js
